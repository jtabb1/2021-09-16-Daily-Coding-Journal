    <p> 
      Yesterday I made good progress on want I want my MVP 
      to be for my coding project. 
    </p>

    <p> 
      Today I went to my Amazon job and now at 8:12 pm I am 
      home and ready to work.  I intend to work on my project, 
      work on my non-Amazon job (get my printer working 
      printing documents and a new label for a new tenant), 
      work on my project, go to the gym, eat, and go to 
      sleep.  Praise God for as many of these tasks as I 
      will actually get done!
